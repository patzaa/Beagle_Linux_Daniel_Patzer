1. What's the min and max voltage?


Min: 1,508 V 
Max: 4,46 V

2. What period is it?

4,13 Hz

3. How close is it to 100ms?

f = 1/T = 1/100ms = 10Hz 

dHz = 10Hz â€“ 4.13Hz = 5.87Hz

4. Why do they differ?

-	Timing and Priority issues 
-	Other parallel Processes interfere 

5. Run htop and see how much processor you are using

21%

6) the answer can given through the pdf file
 
7) no stable period. With ./togglegpio.sh it changes due to a exp-function
 
8) The period has now 4.3HZ.
 
9) no not really.
 
10) No changes
 
11) The maxiumum is around 30HZ. Than the CPU is at the maximum of 100%.
