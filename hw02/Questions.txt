1. What's the min and max voltage?


Min: 1,508 V 
Max: 4,46 V

2. What period is it?

4,13 Hz

3. How close is it to 100ms?

f = 1/T = 1/100ms = 10Hz 

dHz = 10Hz â€“ 4.13Hz = 5.87Hz

4. Why do they differ?

-	Timing and Priority issues 
-	Other parallel Processes interfere 

5. Run htop and see how much processor you are using

21%

6. Try different values for the sleep time (2nd argument). What's the shortest period you can get? Make a table of the values you try and the corresponding period and processor usage. 

the answer is on the pdf file in the repo
 
7. How stable is the period?

no stable period. With ./togglegpio.sh it changes due to a exp-function
 
8. Try launching something like vi. How stable is the period?

The period has now 4.3HZ.
 
9. Try cleaning up togglegpio.sh and removing unneeded lines. Does it impact the period?

no not really.
 
10. togglegpio uses bash (first line in file). Try using sh. Is the period shorter?

No changes
 
11. What's the shortest period you can get?

The maximum is around 30HZ. Than the CPU is at the maximum of 100%.
