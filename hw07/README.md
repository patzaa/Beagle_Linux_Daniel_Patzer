# Blynk 

Blynk is a simple way to use a device such as a smartphone to control you BeagleBone. I executed the leds.js script to control the internal LED0 and read input form buttom P_25. (Picture1 for proof). 

# Slider 

The slider.js is a simple file which controls the brightness of an external LED attached to ‘P9_14’ via the Blynk app. Additionally the slider value get printed to the console (Range 0-1023).
