# in this homework 9 the task was to compare GPIO performance through the PRU and the regular ARM structure 

The lab results are in measurement_HW09.pdf 

to execute the code be sure to run the setup(to define what c File to us), make and pinconfig first

The important code files i used and edited for my needs are:

# 2.6 Blinking an LED
hello.c

# 5.3 PWM Generator
pwm1.c

# 5.4 Controlling the PWM Frequency
pwm4.c

# 5.5 Loop Unrolling for Better Performance
pwm5.c

# 5.9 Reading an Input at Regular Intervals
input1.c
